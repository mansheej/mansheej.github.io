_Hi!_ I'm a Ph.D. student at Stanford University investigating the principles and mechanisms that underlie
learning in neural networks. My research focuses on understanding how the data distribution and optimization choices
drive the encoding of information and emergence of computational abilities. My goal is to use these insights to design
interventions in training that can make models more efficient, reliable, and controllable.

I am currently advised by [Surya Ganguli](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/surya.html) and am a part-time intern at 
[FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/). Previously, I was at the [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford 
University where I worked with partners at the Internal Revenue Service and Deparment of Labor on using machine 
learning to optimally allocate scarse government resources.

I have also volunteered for [SF New Deal](https://sfnewdeal.org/) where I helped research and draft their [economic
impact report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e75a094a5e7414c1d12b773/t/5f8ddd68286841680af0c5ef/1603132818535/impact-report).
Whenever I get the chance, I like to go out social dancing and am part of [Cardinal West Coast Swing](https://www.facebook.com/cardinalswing/) and the [Stanford Tango Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/StanfordTangoClub/?mibextid=6NoCDW).
