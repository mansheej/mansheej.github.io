_Hi!_ I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University studying the principles and mechanisms that underlie learning in neural networks. My research focuses on:

- How does data affect what information and computational abilities are learned by networks?
- How can we engineer the data distribution to train networks to be more reliable, adaptable, and controllable. 

Recently, I have worked on using the data distribution and properties of loss landscapes to make training more efficient, both in terms of requiring less data and training sparser networks. I am currently excited about investigating how the data distribution effects in-context learning, memorization, federated learning and continual learning.

I am advised by [Surya Ganguli](https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/surya.html) and am an intern at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/). Previously, I was at the [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I worked with partners at the Internal Revenue Service and Deparment of Labor on using machine learning to make government administrative processes more efficient. Before graduate school, I did my undergraduate at Brown University where I studied random matrix theory and its application to black hole physics.

I have also volunteered for [SF New Deal](https://sfnewdeal.org/) where I helped research and draft their [economic impact report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e75a094a5e7414c1d12b773/t/5f8ddd68286841680af0c5ef/1603132818535/impact-report). Whenever I get the chance, I like to go out social dancing and am part of [Cardinal West Coast Swing](https://www.facebook.com/cardinalswing/) and the [Stanford Tango Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/StanfordTangoClub/?mibextid=6NoCDW).
