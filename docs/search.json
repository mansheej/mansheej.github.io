    "text": "Hi, I am a research scientist at Mosaic AI Research, Databricks.\nMy research spans pre-training and post-training LLMs with a focus on optimizing data quality, distribution and curricula. I currently build synthetic data pipelines that scale inference compute to create diverse generations and develop strategies to verify and filter them into high-quality training data. Through rigorous evaluation of model behavior and how it is shaped by training data properties, I aim to create reliable, consistent and trustworthy AI systems.\nPreviously, I did my Ph.D.Â in Applied Physics at Stanford University where I was advised by Surya Ganguli and spent some time as a research intern at FAIR, Meta AI. During this time, I worked on the science of deep learning through the lens of data, loss landscapes and neural tangent kernels.\nYou can find my publications on Google Scholar.\n\nI have also volunteered for SF New Deal where I helped research and draft their economic impact report. Whenever I get the chance, I like to go out social dancing, mostly West Coast Swing."
